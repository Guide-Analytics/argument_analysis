Lovely little Greek restaurant! Beautiful interior and the food was delicious. I had the mousaka and a Greek Tempest, but also tried the chicken souvlaki. A bit on the pricier side, but it was well worth it.","5 stars","a month ago","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117666129723135331456/reviews?hl=en-CA","Like","","2019-07-25 12:28:44 PM"

You might think to yourself , well what about the other food ? Why is this review just about potatoes.
The food itself is amazing , but order potatoes and you will see why the first thing I said was best potatoes in town. This is 5 out of 5 on the potatoes alone. 

Like words cannot describe how good this is because the English language doesn't have them.","5 stars","6 months ago","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102794584068359136011/reviews?hl=en-CA","Like 1","","2019-07-25 12:29:25 PM"

The food was sub-par for the prices asked. Two people at our table received only part of their orders, and water was only served when asked for. There was an hour wait between drink orders. I was given an uncleaned plate during the appetizer. One of the worst restaurant experiences I've had.

I've been to Greek diners with better food and service for half the price. Had I thought to ask at the time, I would have asked to comp my meal as It was basically inedible (completely dried out meat, undercooked rice dish, etc.). I only hope that my experience varies greatly from the average.","1 star","4 months ago","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108999449873979008478/reviews?hl=en-CA","Like","","2019-07-25 12:29:46 PM"

Service was very good and the chef will alter the menu such as changing sauces to your own preference. The Lamb chops with shrimp special was delicious and the Bistro penne was exceptionally good. The restaurant is small and the booths make for a quieter relaxing dining experience. You can actually carry on a conversation with your friends unlike many of the popular Guelph rerstaurants. Definately will be back. This place never disappoints from the service to the delicious meals and the lovely decor! The food is always hot, very tasty and plentiful! Make a reservation though as it fills up quickly. Plenty of free parking! Prices are very reasonable also!","5 stars","3 months ago","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110960404111337625629/reviews?hl=en-CA","Like","","2019-07-25 12:31:11 PM"

The decor was wonderful, with a pleasant atmosphere. Food was great, with plenty of choice in the menu. It tasted exceptional as well. I would go back just to try something new here.

Definitely recommend going to this restaurant. It is truly a hidden gem, based on first impressions.","4 stars","6 years ago","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107795416179405680326/reviews?hl=en-CA","Like","","2019-07-25 12:44:51 PM"
